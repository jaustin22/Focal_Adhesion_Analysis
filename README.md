# Focal_Adhesion_Analysis
Python code using OpenCV to automatically analyze and calculate focal adhesion area

This is a python jupyter notebook to automatically analyze a fluorescent protein image and calculate
the size of focal adhesions in the image. This project is intended for researchers and scientists looking to 
automatically calculate areas of focal adhesions, which are usually identified by bright clusters in fluorescent 
images.<br> 
This code can also be modified to suit other purposes of automatically outlining and calculating area of other similar clusters. <br>
This code is written utilizing packages and functions from OpenCV, an open source computer vision library.
